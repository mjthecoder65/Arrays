# Arrays Problems

# Problem 1 (Peak Element)

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.

```python
# Approach 1
# Time complexity: O(N)
# Space complexity: O(1)
def findPeakElement(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
            return i
    return len(arr) - 1
```

```python
def findPeakElement(arr : List[int]) -> int:
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while (left < right):
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if (arr[mid] > arr[mid]):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left
```
